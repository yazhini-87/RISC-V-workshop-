# 🦋 RISC-V-workshop
**This repository encapsulates my journey through the 5-day online RISC-V MYTH workshop**
**collaboratively organized by VLSI System Design (VSD) Corp. Pvt. Ltd. and Redwood EDA**.
**The workshop aimed to provide participants with hands-on experience in understanding**

- The RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) 
- developing a RISC-V CPU core using Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) on the Makerchip platform.
- process design
- pipelining concept
