# RV Day 1:Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain 
## RV-D1SK1-Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords  
### RV_D1SK1_L1-Introduction 
- Introduction to the **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture**
    - Code Flow: High-Level Languages (C, Java, Python) â†’ Assembly (RISC-V, ARM, x86) â†’ Binary Machine Code (0s and 1s)
    - Assembly code is executed using processor designs based on **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** logic.

### ðŸ›  RV_D1SK1_L2 â€“ Software to Hardware Pathway
- Flow of Execution:  
  - **Applications** â†’ **System Software** â†’ **Operating System** (Linux, Windows, macOS) â†’ **Compiler** â†’ **Assembler** â†’         **Hardware**
-  **Operating System Responsibilities**:
  1. Managing Input/Output devices
  2. Allocating system memory
  3. Executing low-level system functions

###  RV_D1SK1_L3 â€“ Course Outline & Instruction Types
- Hands-on C Programming Introduction
- Classification of Instructions:
  1. **Pseudo Instructions** â€“ Simplified commands (not data-handling)
  2. **RV64I** â€“ Core Integer instructions
  3. **RV64M** â€“ Extensions for multiplication/division
  4. **RV64F/D** â€“ Floating-point operations
-  Explored the **Application Binary Interface (ABI)**: Register usage, stack pointer roles, and memory allocation basics
